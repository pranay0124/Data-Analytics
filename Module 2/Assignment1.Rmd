This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
#1
cc = read.csv("climate_change.csv")
trainingSet = subset(cc, cc$Year <= 2006)
testingSet = subset(cc, cc$Year > 2006)

model1 = lm(Temp ~ MEI+CO2+CH4+N2O+CFC.11+CFC.12+TSI+Aerosols, data = trainingSet)
summary(model1)
```

```{r}
#4
cor(trainingSet)
```

```{r}
#6
model2 = lm(Temp ~ MEI+TSI+Aerosols+N2O, data = trainingSet)
summary(model2)
```

```{r}
#8
model1_new = step(model1)
summary(model1_new)
```

```{r}
#10
predictTest = predict(model1_new, newdata = testingSet)
SSE = sum((predictTest - testingSet$Temp)^2)
SST = sum((mean(trainingSet$Temp) - testingSet$Temp)^2)
R2 = 1 - SSE/SST
