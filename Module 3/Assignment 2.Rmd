This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
FluTrain = read.csv("FluTrain.csv")

# QUESTION 1

hist(FluTrain$ILI, breaks = 100)
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 2, 3

plot(log(FluTrain$ILI), log(FluTrain$Queries))
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 4

FluTrend1 = lm(log(ILI) ~ Queries, data = FluTrain)
summary(FluTrend1)

```

```{r}
# QUESTION 5

cor(log(FluTrain$ILI), FluTrain$Queries)
# correalation_value ^ 2 =  R-squaredvalue
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 6

FluTest = read.csv("FluTest.csv")
PredTest1 = exp(predict(FluTrend1, newdata=FluTest))
PredTest1[which(FluTest$Week == "2012-03-11 - 2012-03-17")]
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 7

subset(FluTest, Week=="2012-03-11 - 2012-03-17")
# relative_error = (Observed ILI - Estimated ILI)/Observed ILI

(2.293422 - 2.187378)/2.293422
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 8

SSE = sum((PredTest1-FluTest$ILI)^2)
RMSE = sqrt(SSE / nrow(FluTest))
RMSE
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 9

# the value of -2 passed to lag means to return 2 observations before the current one;
# a positive value would have returned future observations.
# na.pad=TRUE means to add missing values for the first two weeks of our dataset, where we can't compute the data from 2 weeks earlier.

ILILag2 = lag(zoo(FluTrain$ILI), -2, na.pad=TRUE)
FluTrain$ILILag2 = coredata(ILILag2)
summary(FluTrain)
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 10

plot(log(FluTrain$ILILag2), log(FluTrain$ILI))
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 11, 12, 13

FluTrend2 = lm(log(ILI) ~ Queries + log(ILILag2), data = FluTrain)
summary(FluTrend2)
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 14, 15, 16

ILILag2 = lag(zoo(FluTest$ILI), -2, na.pad=TRUE)
FluTest$ILILag2 = coredata(ILILag2)
summary(FluTest)
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 17

FluTrain$ILI[nrow(FluTrain)-1]
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 18

FluTrain$ILI[nrow(FluTrain)]
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 19

PredTest1 = exp(predict(FluTrend1, newdata=FluTest))
PredTest2 = exp(predict(FluTrend2, newdata=FluTest))
SSE = sum((PredTest2 - FluTest$ILI)^2)
SSE

RMSE = sqrt(SSE/nrow(FluTest))
RMSE
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 20

SSE = sum((PredTest1 - FluTest$ILI)^2)
SSE

RMSE = sqrt(SSE/nrow(FluTest))
RMSE
```
