This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
statedata = read.csv("statedata.csv")

# to plot 
plot(statedata$x, statedata$y)

# the highest average high school graduation rate of all the states in the region

which.max(tapply(statedata$HS.Grad, statedata$state.region, mean))

# a boxplot of the murder rate by region

boxplot(statedata$Murder ~ statedata$state.region) 

# see that there is an outlier in the Northeast region of the boxplot you just generated. Which state does this correspond to?

NortheastData = subset(statedata, state.region == "Northeast")
table(NortheastData$state.abb, NortheastData$Murder)

# to create a linear regression model

regModel = lm(Life.Exp ~ Population + Income + Illiteracy + Murder + HS.Grad + Frost + Area, data=statedata)
summary(regModel)

# to plot

plot(statedata$Income, statedata$Life.Exp)

#state actually has the lowest life expectancy

statedata$state.name[which.min(statedata$Life.Exp)]

# For which state do we make the largest absolute error

sort(abs(regModel$residuals))
