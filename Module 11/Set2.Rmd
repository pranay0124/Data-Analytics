This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
#1
movies = read.table("Movies.txt", header = FALSE, sep = "|", quote = "\"")
colnames(movies) = c("ID","Title","ReleaseDate","VideoReleaseDate","IMDB","Unknown","Action","Adventure","Animation","Childrens","Comedy","Crime","Documentary","Drama","Fantasy","FilmNoir","Horror","Musical","Mystery","Romance","SciFi","Thriller","War","Western")
str(movies)
movies$ID = NULL
movies$Title = NULL
movies$ReleaseDate = NULL
movies$VideoReleaseDate = NULL
table(movies$Action == 1, movies$Horror == 1)
