This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

statesMap = map_data("state")

# QUESTION 1.1

length(table(statesMap$group))

# QUESTION 1.2

ggplot(statesMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "pink")
```

# QUESTION 2.1

polling = read.csv("PollingImputed.csv")

Train = subset(polling, Year < 2012)

Test = subset(polling, Year == 2012)

mod2 = glm(Republican~SurveyUSA+DiffCount, data=Train, family="binomial")

TestPrediction = predict(mod2, newdata=Test, type="response")

TestPredictionBinary = as.numeric(TestPrediction > 0.5)

predictionDataFrame = data.frame(TestPrediction, TestPredictionBinary, Test$State)

table(TestPredictionBinary)

mean(TestPrediction)

# QUESTION 2.2

predictionDataFrame$region = tolower(predictionDataFrame$Test.State)

predictionMap = merge(statesMap, predictionDataFrame, by = "region")

predictionMap = predictionMap[order(predictionMap$order),]

str(predictionMap)

# QUESTION 2.4

ggplot(predictionMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TestPredictionBinary)) + geom_polygon(color = "black")

# QUESTION 2.5
