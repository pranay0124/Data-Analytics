This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
#1
machine = read.csv("machine.csv")
model1 = lm(PRP ~ X+MYCT+MMIN+MMAX+CACH+CHMIN+CHMAX, data = machine)
```

```{r}
#2
summary(model1)
#answer = MYCT, MMIN, MMAX, CACH, CHMAX
```

```{r}
#3
machine2 = subset(machine, select=-c(VendorName, ModelName, ERP, PRP))
cor(machine2)

#answer = MMAX is highly corelated with MMIN (0.75782678)
```

```{r}

machine3 = subset(machine, select=-c(VendorName, ModelName, ERP))
cor(machine3)

#answer = PRP is highly corelated with MMAX (0.86557615)

# X, MYCT has the correlation between -0.4 to 0.4
