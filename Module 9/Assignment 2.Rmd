This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
airlines = read.csv("AirlinesCluster.csv")

#1.1:
summary(airlines)

#1.3:
install.packages("caret")
library(caret)
preproc = preProcess(airlines)
airlinesNorm = predict(preproc, airlines)
summary(airlinesNorm)
```


```{r}
#2.1:
airlinesDist = dist(airlinesNorm, method = "euclidean")
airlinesclust = hclust(airlinesDist, method = "ward.D")
plot(airlinesclust)

#2.2:
airline = cutree(airlinesclust, k=5)
table(airline)

#2.3:
lapply(split(airlines, airline), colMeans)

#2.4:
set.seed(88)
kmeansclust = kmeans(airlinesNorm, centers=5, iter.max=1000)
table(kmeansclust$cluster)
```
