This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# QUESTION 1.1

census = read.csv("census.csv")
library(caTools)
set.seed(2000)
spl = sample.split(census$over50k, SplitRatio = 0.6)
train = subset(census, spl==TRUE)
test = subset(census, spl==FALSE)
censusglm = glm( over50k ~ . , family="binomial", data = train)
summary(censusglm)
```


```{r}
# QUESTION 1.2

predictTest = predict(censusglm, newdata = test, type = "response")
table(test$over50k, predictTest >= 0.5)

# If we divide the sum of the main diagonal by the sum of all of the entries in the matrix, we obtain the accuracy:

(9051+1888)/(9051+662+1190+1888)
```


```{r}
# QUESTION 1.3

table(test$over50k)
9713/(9713+3078)
```


```{r}
# QUESTION 1.4

library(ROCR)
ROCRpred = prediction(predictTest, test$over50k)
as.numeric(performance(ROCpred, "auc")@y.values)
```


```{r}
# QUESTION 2.1, 2.2, 2.3

library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
censustree = rpart( over50k ~ . , method="class", data = train)
prp(censustree)
```


```{r}
# QUESTION 2.4

predictTest = predict(censustree, newdata = test, type = "class")
table(test$over50k, predictTest)

# To compute the accuracy, sum the diagonal entries and divide by the sum of all of the terms:

(9243+1596)/(9243+470+1482+1596)
```


```{r}
# QUESTION 2.6

library(ROCR)
predictTest = predict(censustree, newdata = test)
predictTest = predictTest[,2]

 # Compute the AUC:

ROCRpred = prediction(predictTest, test$over50k)
as.numeric(performance(ROCRpred, "auc")@y.values)
```

```{r}
# QUESTION 3.1

set.seed(1)
censusrf = randomForest(over50k ~ . , data = trainSmall)
predictTest = predict(censusrf, newdata=test)
table(test$over50k, predictTest)
(9614+1050)/nrow(test)
```


```{r}
# QUESTION 3.2

vu = varUsed(MODEL, count=TRUE)

vusorted = sort(vu, decreasing = FALSE, index.return = TRUE)

dotchart(vusorted$x, names(MODEL$forest$xlevels[vusorted$ix]))
```

# QUESTION 4.1
library(caret)
set.seed(2)
fitControl = trainControl( method = "cv", number = 10 )
cartGrid = expand.grid( .cp = seq(0.002,0.1,0.002))

```{r}
# QUESTION 4.2
